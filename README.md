## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README

Update this file as you go along to record your progress.
my uploaded sketch is of a lady and a sun. i want to have the sun pulse to represent seconds, while adding a flower in the background per minuet. once it has reached 60, it will reset.
for the hours, the position of the lady and the sun/moon will change to the placements on a conventional analog clock.
the colour for am and pm will differ. light being am, and dark being pm. the sun will change colour to resemble a moon for pm too.
i am still deciding whether to add numbers to be more functional or just have it as a visual experience.
